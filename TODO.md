## TODO

* Make mobile friendly.
* Add space between ascii art and text in intro page.
* Add routing. Now all pages are on the same page.
* icons in svg and png looks differently, fix that.
* In footer not all keys binding used(f1, f3, f5 for example). Delete them. Not all works when click on them with mouse(game)
* DO you think all items in TUI panel should be prefixed with ▶ even if they are not expandable? Maybe it should be expandable by spreccing space, and page opened by pressing enter?
* On installation guides page make it navigable with keyboard arrows when i switch to page content with tab.
* For some reason published version of the game played at much faster speed. You need to press button at much higher frequency to play it. Find out why. Site deployed to glidermcp.com
* Add sound effects to the game.
* On pricing page make my mail clickable and hidden from bots.
* Add claude or agents.md to help with content generation.

# TGlider TypeScript Workflow

Use TGlider when working in a TypeScript or JavaScript repository and the task needs semantic facts rather than plain text search.

Start by loading the relevant workspace when needed. Prefer semantic symbol, reference, export, diagnostic, hierarchy, call graph, impact, and dependency tools before reading source text. Use source reads only for bounded context after the semantic tools identify the relevant files or symbols.

For edits, gather evidence first with tools for references, callers, outgoing calls, diagnostics, dependency topology, and change impact. Prefer preview-first refactoring tools where available, and refresh diagnostics after meaningful edits.

For non-code assets, generated output, literal config files, and repo-wide text search, prefer Scout's `find`. TGlider's own `search_text` searches with Scout and requires it - without a `scout` binary on `PATH` it returns a `scout_not_installed` hint, so install Scout globally to use that tool at all. Use shell text search only when neither can answer the question.

# GliderMCP C# Workflow

Use GliderMCP when working in a C# or .NET repository and the task needs semantic facts rather than plain text search.

Start by checking `server_status`. If no workspace is loaded, call `load` with the relevant `.sln`, `.slnx`, or `.csproj`. Prefer `find_code` as the front door when the user asks to locate behavior by intent. Use `search_symbols`, `resolve_symbol`, or `get_symbol_at_position` before symbol-specific tools, and treat returned `symbolKey` values as opaque stable identities.

For edits, gather evidence first with tools such as `find_references`, `find_implementations`, `find_callers`, `get_outgoing_calls`, `analyze_change_impact`, `get_cascade_impact`, `get_diagnostics`, and `diagnostic_hotspots`. Prefer preview-first refactoring tools where available. After external edits, use `sync` for changed `.cs` files and `reload` for structural project changes.

For literal strings and text inside the loaded workspace, use Glider's own `search_text`. It searches the documents the workspace has loaded - source plus any additional files and analyzer config a project declares - and always reports `data.coverage: loadedDocuments`. Before reading a zero-hit result as proof something is absent, compare `documentsSearched` with `documentsMatchedScope` and check `documentsUnreadable`.

For anything the workspace has not loaded - other languages, generated output, or files no project references - prefer Scout's `find` when Scout is installed as its own MCP server. Glider does not call Scout; they are separate servers, so install and configure Scout on its own to get that coverage. Use shell text search only when neither can answer the question.
